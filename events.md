### April 5, 2023 9-10:00am PT on Zoom
## INSciTS Team Science Seminar: Linking SciTS and Big Team Science to Advance Complex Collaborations

The rise of big team science has vitalized conversations about how scientific contributions are recognized and rewarded. This panel will discuss challenges with this complex area of research as detailed in Coles et al. (2022; 2023), with an emphasis on one of the central issues in these conversations – what constitutes authorship in science. Perspectives on authorship vary both within and between individual researchers, scientific organizations, publishers, and science stakeholders. Three panelists from big team science initiatives will review their perspectives and experiences with these issues–and audience members will be encouraged to submit additional questions and join the conversation.

* Dr. Drew Altschul, *University of Edinburgh, ManyPrimates*, panelist
* Dr. Heidi Baumgartner, *Stanford University, ManyBabies*, panelist
* Dr. Nicholas Coles, *Stanford University, Psychological Science Accelerator*, panelist
* Dr. Stephen M. Fiore, *University of Central Florida, INSciTS*, moderator

## *Panel:* Authorship challenges in big team science

The rise of big team science (Coles et al., 2022) has vitalized conversations about how scientific contributions are recognized and rewarded. For example, what constitutes authorship in science? Perspectives on this issue vary both within and between individual researchers, scientific organizations, publishers, and science stakeholders. For example, some groups have developed models that distinguish between (a) author vs. non-author contributions, (b) individual vs. group contributions, and so on (Council of Science Editors, 2006). Others have endorsed models that do not make such distinctions and instead include taxonomies for describing the nature of researchers’ contributions (Allen, Brand, Scott, Altman, & Hlava, 2014; Holcombe, 2019; Moshontz et al., 2018).

This panel will bring together diverse perspectives to discuss various authorship challenges in big team science. This will include (1) decisions about consortium vs. non-consortium authorship, (2) handling authorship disputes, (3) collaboration agreements, (4) acknowledging diverse contributions, and (5) navigating differences in authorship standards. Attendees will also be encouraged to bring their own questions and contribute to the conversation.
