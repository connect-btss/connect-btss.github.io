is an SSHRC-funded partnership that unites seven Big Team Social Science (BTSS) networks comprising more than 3,500 researchers from over 70 countries. These research networks are joined by four community organizations dedicated to improving science. We're applying a "Team of Big Teams" approach to understand and solve the unique challenges of large-scale collaborative social science research, making it more reliable, inclusive, and impactful.
