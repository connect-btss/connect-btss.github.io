## The Challenge We're Addressing
The replication crisis has shaken public trust in social science. Traditional small-scale studies with unrepresentative samples have produced findings that often fail to replicate. Big Team Social Science offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance research quality through larger sample sizes, standardized methodologies, diverse participants and researchers, and expanded research scope. However, scaling up social science research presents unique challenges that physics or genomics solutions can't addressâ€”social behavior varies dramatically across contexts, cultures, and species.


## Our Solution
CONNECT brings together the people best equipped to solve these challenges: those actually conducting BTSS research. Rather than forcing each network to reinvent solutions independently, we create forums to unite expertise, share resources, and collectively improve research practices.
