Every year, CONNECT partners come together to host the [Big Team Science Conference (BTSCON)](https://bigteamscienceconference.github.io/), a multidisciplinary gathering of researchers, funders, and stakeholders to discuss advancements, challenges, and future opportunities related to large scientific collaborations. 

Several of our CONNECT partner organizations and networks recently presented their amazing work at the **4th annual BTSCON, held virtually on October 6-8, 2025.**
