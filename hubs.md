CONNECT operates through **two collaborative research hubs**, the *BiTS Lab* and *ManyManys*, that facilitate knowledge co-creation and translation, supported by **three specialized working groups** that drive our core initiatives.

## Research Hubs

### Big Team Science (BiTS) Lab
The BiTS Lab serves as our primary collaborative space where partners collectively conduct participatory action research on BTSS infrastructure and best practices. The BiTS Lab brings together all network partners, community partners, and academic collaborators through quarterly meetings to share expertise, identify common challenges, test collaborative solutions, and develop novel tools where gaps exist. The BiTS Lab also organizes Research Summits for intensive in-person collaboration and coordinates activities across all working groups.

### ManyManys
[ManyManys](https://manymanys.github.io/) represents an unprecedented cross-species collaboration where our network partners unite to conduct joint empirical BTSS projects. This hub focuses on developing novel approaches to studying cognitive skills like across multiple social species simultaneously. The multidisciplinary nature of comparative research maximizes methodological variation that must be resolved for effective science, making ManyManys both a groundbreaking research initiative and a robust testing ground for innovative BTSS workflows. ManyManys is designed to expand significantly and evolve into a self-sustaining independent network.

        <h4><a href="">Metascience working group</a></h4>
        <i>This working group conducts metascientific research to understand current processes and workflows in existing BTSS networks. The team gathers qualitative information about current workflows, identifies existing assessment tools, and develops standardized evaluation instruments for BTSS projects with measurable metrics and benchmarks for cross-project comparison.</i><br>
