CONNECT operates through **two collaborative research hubs** that facilitate knowledge co-creation and translation, supported by **four specialized working groups** that drive our core initiatives.


## Research Hubs

### Big Team Science (BiTS) Lab
The BiTS Lab serves as our primary collaborative space where partners collectively conduct participatory action research on BTSS infrastructure and best practices. The BiTS Lab brings together all network partners, community partners, and academic collaborators through quarterly meetings to share expertise, identify common challenges, test collaborative solutions, and develop novel tools where gaps exist. The BiTS Lab also organizes Research Summits for intensive in-person collaboration and coordinates activities across all working groups.

### ManyManys
[ManyManys](https://manymanys.github.io/) represents an unprecedented cross-species collaboration where our network partners unite to conduct joint empirical BTSS projects. This hub focuses on developing novel approaches to studying cognitive skills like across multiple social species simultaneously. The multidisciplinary nature of comparative research maximizes methodological variation that must be resolved for effective science, making ManyManys both a groundbreaking research initiative and a robust testing ground for innovative BTSS workflows. ManyManys is designed to expand significantly and evolve into a self-sustaining independent network.


## Working Groups

### Measurement Development & Data Collection
This working group conducts metascientific research to understand current processes and workflows in existing BTSS networks. The team gathers qualitative information about current workflows, identifies existing assessment tools, and develops standardized evaluation instruments for BTSS projects with measurable metrics and benchmarks for cross-project comparison.
***Working group leads:** [Krista Byers-Heinlein](mailto:k.byers@concordia.ca) and [Nicol√°s Alessandroni](mailto:nicolas.alessandroni@concordia.ca)*

### Infrastructure & Tool Development
This working group translates research insights into practical solutions by designing, implementing, and refining tools and infrastructure to enhance BTSS efficiency. Current focus areas include developing a data validator tool, and customizable BTSS lab manuals.
*Working group leads: [Melanie Soderstrom](mailto:melsod@babylanguagelab.org) and [Francis Yuen](mailto:francis.yuen@psych.ubc.ca)*

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)
This working group promotes inclusivity across all aspects of BTSS, development of EDI strategies tailored to BTSS challenges, and creation of inclusive meeting practices that address barriers like time zone differences and language accessibility.
***Our regional outreach coordinators:** TBD* 
***Working group leads:** [Nadia Corral-Frias](mailto:nadia.corral@unison.mx), [Kiley Hamlin](mailto:kiley.hamlin@psych.ubc.ca), and [Eon-Suk Ko](mailto:eonsuk@gmail.com)*

### Knowledge Mobilization and Training
This cross-cutting working group ensures that insights, tools, and best practices reach both network partners and the broader scientific community through peer-reviewed publications, how-to videos and workshops, conference presentations, training opportunities, and coordination between all other working groups.
***Working group leads:** [Michael Frank](mailto:mcfrank@stanford.edu) and [Heidi Baumgartner](mailto:heidib@manybabies.org)*
